# Space_Shooter_Game
An interesting space shooting game

It is being one of the favourite game for me from the list of games that I have designed.
It consists of shooter where at a time only one bullet is available.
Also there are eight enemies who will be falling from the top to the shooter.
When the shooter shoots one of the enemy it gets disappeared and will be positioned in any other places also 10 points will be given for the shooter.
Hence always there will be eight enemies and the game ends when any one of the enemy touches the side in which the shooter resides.
It's always been my favourite and also it can be played my kids as well as adults since the difficulty is suitable for both of them.
This is also a Python Based Game.
